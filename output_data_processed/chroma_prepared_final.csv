"amazon_review_amazon_B0BTBP5T15_0","5.0 out of 5 stars great quality cameras, solid app, some opportunities for improvement. the media could not be loaded. i bought these a couple months ago to replace a set of arlo cameras after getting annoyed that they started charging a monthly fee for their services. eufy had what i wanted with a good quality resolution cameras, local storage, and a number of ai features.first, the good -- super easy setup- great quality camera resolution with enough settings (ie. spotlight, night vision settings, activity zones, etc). the recording attached is from the middle of the night with only the camera spotlight providing the light, and it’s still good quality.- long battery life (after 2 months i still have 70%+ in all cameras, including some that record frequently- the local storage is great. even with just the included storage, i have more than i need to record multiple months. when accessing old recordings, it’s super fast to pull them up and play them, which was an issue with some other camera sets i tried (like tp- link tapo cameras with onboard storage)- the app is easy to use and seems reliable - i have tested geolocation options which worked well, but also scheduled options and the camera accurately changes modes in both settings- no subscription fees!the areas for improvement:- the app doesn’t allow you to mix scheduling and geolocation modes, so if you wanted to put it on a schedule when you are home, and arm all cameras when you are away that’s not an option for you- the ai isnt great - while i like being able to name the people in footage, eufy doesn’t often recognize them in the future. it’s not a big deal as the camera still recognizes its a person, but just cannot tell me who without some time.overall, i would still highly recommend these for someone looking for a subscription-free, high quality cameras set. buy when they are on sale and save yourself $150-200 of the list price. read more","amazon","https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Expandable-Recognition-Spotlight/dp/B0BTBP5T15/ref=sr_1_3","eufy Security eufyCam S300(eufyCam 3C) 2-Cam Kit, Security Camera Outdoor Wireless, 4K Camera, Expandable Local Storage up to 16TB, Face Recognition AI, Color Night Vision, Spotlight, No Monthly Fee","B0BTBP5T15","399.99","4.3","720.0","amazon_review","amazon_B0BTBP5T15_0","5.0 out of 5 stars Great quality cameras, solid app, some opportunities for improvement","5.0","2024-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","5.0 out of 5 stars Great quality cameras, solid app, some opportunities for improvement.

"amazon_review_amazon_B0BTBP5T15_3","4.0 out of 5 stars very good security system, could be the best, the app needs updates.. was a little worried about purchasing this after some of the negative reviews came out about the end-to-end encryption on the live video streams and the fact that unsinking the camera removes the footage. however that seems to be fixed in this latest version.they work well as front door cameras for me in an apartment building. the 4k quality is reasonably good. i shoot with a lot of cameras so i was actually semi-impressed for the price how good the camera turned out to be. granted i wish the infrared light was stronger so it would work in darker indoor spaces. i have them about 4 to 5 ft on either side of the door facing down at a 45° angle. if the lights aren't triggered in the hallway the infrared lights don't necessarily pick up anyone until they touch the door. even if they sold an accessory like an ir light that was tied to the cameras it would help.overall i like how the footage stays on the internal 4 tb hard drive i installed in the base station. i'm not sure i can really comment about the signal quality because my apartment is open concept so they have worked very well. the camera's battery life seems to work well. we will see how they hold up didn't want to bother getting the solar panel versions because i use them indoors.the facial detection works frighteningly and surprisingly well. i wish it had more functionality built into the app hopefully they will update this in the future, because it's kind of not very powerful in terms of the stuff you can do with it. it will recognize almost any face that's at 45° angle to the camera. it seems to have a little trouble if someone is profile but it's pretty close.i like how you can name, and assign tags for individuals. but sadly that's really all you can do with it. it's is very basic. there aren't many tags and there isn't really any functions tied to them in terms of notifications or triggers.for example i actually bought the cameras to make sure a certain person was not coming over unannounced. i was having an issue with this person and possibly considering a restraining order.i had hoped that using the facial recognition software i could set up an alert and actions specifically based on that person.sadly the app doesn't really work like that. the alerts and actions are all the same and has no integration with the actual facial recognition other than telling you the name and the pre-selected category.i could see this is a very helpful tool for people who are considering restraining orders. because you would be able to have documented evidence that someone showed up and you could have a custom notification sent to you immediately. so i'm sad it's not more of a feature.i'm also kind of sad that i couldn't do the reverse for my neighbors. i don't need the cameras being triggered or alerting me every time my neighbors leave the apartment. especially if their face is recognized by the device.i get why the system functions the way it does. it's the simplest implementation of the facial recognition software which keeps the data processing down, and works ok as a novelty for basic family setups. but it would work way better with custom notifications and actions assignable to each person, and i think it could be easily added to the apps functionality.overall i think it's one of the better security systems on the market since i don't have to sign up for some cloud service and share my data all over the web. i also imagine it's why they can implement high resolution 4k cameras easily because those cameras don't have to send all of the footage to a server far from your house.if i had to score it, i would give it 4 out of 5 stars. if they integrated the facial recognition into the app better it would be beyond five stars and miles above any other security system on the market. read more","amazon","https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Expandable-Recognition-Spotlight/dp/B0BTBP5T15/ref=sr_1_3","eufy Security eufyCam S300(eufyCam 3C) 2-Cam Kit, Security Camera Outdoor Wireless, 4K Camera, Expandable Local Storage up to 16TB, Face Recognition AI, Color Night Vision, Spotlight, No Monthly Fee","B0BTBP5T15","399.99","4.3","720.0","amazon_review","amazon_B0BTBP5T15_3","4.0 out of 5 stars Very good security system, Could be the best, the app needs updates.","4.0","2023-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","4.0 out of 5 stars Very good security system, Could be the best, the app needs updates..

"amazon_review_amazon_B07X5W6QB1_3","4.0 out of 5 stars great cameras for the price!. i'll start off by saying i originally bought an arlo pro 2 system. much to my disappointment, the package got 'lost in the mail' so i ended up ordering this camera system by sheer luck. i had been watching several review videos trying to decide between arlo and ring since both were on sale via black friday when i saw these. the one thing that attracted me to these were the price and no monthly subscription fee!!!!!!fast forward got it delivered and was very happy with what i got. i received 3 cameras and a base station. base station is very small and sleek and has great range to to my cameras. cameras are decently heavy and don't feel cheap. they don't come that charged, so i had to charge them one by one off the base station(which didn't take long).setup was a breeze. plugged the base station in, hooked it up to the ol modem via ethernet cable and downloaded the app and followed the setup instructions. it's a pretty straightforward process. set up an account and the app walks you through the rest of the process step by step. what i liked about the app is you can take your phone over to a spot you want to put a camera and it'll tell you the signal strength; which i found extremely useful and helped to determine where to put my cameras. installing the cameras took no time at all either.once the cameras were set up, we did some test runs and everything worked great(at first). the picture quality is great. the night vision is amazing. the microphone is so good i can hear our conversations inside the house. the app was user friendly as well. on a side note, there is a small delay in response time as far as notifications go, but it's not enough to matter. from what i've read, all the brands do. you have to be practical with your expectations too. the camera has to record, send that clip to the base station, then the base station has to download it and get it out to you via the internet. if you want faster response times, i recommend getting a fast internet connection.finally, this is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. after the front door camera was installed, it was super finicky. when we did test runs with it, it worked great. the next day, however, we had received 2 packages and didn't receive notifications. then we started conducting more test runs and still couldn't get it to work 100%. frustrated, we finally took the camera down and repositioned it. since then, we have had zero problems. all 3 cameras work flawlessly. we think the problem was the angle we had it positioned and we had it up a little too high. we moved it down some and centered it on the door and it did the job.if you're trying to decide and are a researcher like i am, go with these cameras. i feel very satisfied with my purchase. they have worked great and are such great deal compared to the other systems out there; especially since there is no monthly subscription fee. if you do decide to buy these, i just recommend installing them between 6 to 8 ft from the ground and you shouldn't have any problems. read more","amazon","https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-eufyCam-Wireless-180-Day/dp/B07X5W6QB1/ref=sr_1_4","eufy Security, eufyCam 2C 3-Cam Kit, Security Camera Wireless Outdoor, Home Security System, HomeKit Compatibility, 1080p HD, IP67, Night Vision, Motion Only Alert, No Monthly Fee","B07X5W6QB1","329.99","4.4","15.0","amazon_review","amazon_B07X5W6QB1_3","4.0 out of 5 stars Great cameras for the price!","4.0","2020-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","4.0 out of 5 stars Great cameras for the price!.

Night vision is excellent and there are plenty of other features within the app. Oh, and the AI it uses is incredible, you can record in your home and have it only recognize a pet or individual person instead of it notifying you of everything it sees. Talking through it also works perfectly. Little to no delay on streaming. 5 stars.

"amazon_review_amazon_B0CX8W4ZQV_4","4.0 out of 5 stars really like!. i am very impressed so far with these cameras. first off, very fast delivery, as i ordered them on friday and got them saturday. set them up today, sunday, and the setup process was very easy and the ring app is too! i do have them both sitting on window seals, as they are the perfect size, not too tall, not too short, same for skinny or fat. one is in my window seal in the front of the house and the other in the window seal in the back of the house. picture quality is great, but for the night vision to work properly, you do have to go into the settings in the ring app and shut one of the options listed in there to off, otherwise it will cause a major glare. only gave it 4 stars again, as i didn't have any package deliveries and i basically bought it for that purpose, as i don't live in a 'crime' area, but you never know when a pkg could be stolen, i live on a very busy street, so i have to wait and see how they pick up the delivery drivers coming to my doors. but, i do feel more secure and safe with these cameras as well, you can check them anytime you want in the ring app on your mobile phone/tablet and review history or current status, even though you will get an alert if there are subjects picked up on camera, but since this is new to me i like to go and check them even without any alerts. now the picture quality like i said is great, but not exceptional, as the cameras are in front of windows, but i really really like them! i am glad i purchased them and so far worth the price! the plug in cord is long which is nice, but i did order additional plug in cords that are 16ft if and when i may need them, but i may return those, as i don't plan on moving the cameras from where they're sitting now anytime soon. would love to give them 5 stars, but again have to wait for more deliveries to my doors. lastly, ring gives you a 180 day trial period to see if you like how the recordings and such are working out for you before you subscribe, which is great, even though i will be purchasing the subscription, you never know when you will need proof of something on camera! better to be safe than sorry! hope this helps. read more","amazon","https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Ring-Pan-Tilt-coverage-Two-Way/dp/B0CX8W4ZQV/ref=sr_1_1","Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam | See all around with 360° pan coverage, HD video, plus Two-Way Talk (2024 release) | 2-Pack, White","B0CX8W4ZQV","","4.7","3.0","amazon_review","amazon_B0CX8W4ZQV_4","4.0 out of 5 stars Really like!","4.0","2025-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","4.0 out of 5 stars Really like!.
