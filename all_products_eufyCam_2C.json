                    "comment": "This system was easy to install and set up. I already had a few devices in the Eufy ecosystem, so adding these was a breeze. I was able to install the cameras in minutes (probably 10-15 minutes each), and after spending a few minutes tweaking the motion detection settings I was up and running.I am pleased with the camera quality and they work well at night and in low light conditions. Viewing the camera feeds with the app is simple and effective. The only unknown right now is battery life for the cameras, so we’ll have to see how that works out.The default configuration is to plug the HomeBase unit directly into your router via Ethernet cable (this is how I did it), but the manual does state that it is possible to connect it using WiFi if desired.This package is built around the HomeBase 2, which is the older version but it does the job. The storage is limited, and not expandable. I could definitely see myself upgrading to HomeBase 3 in the future if I need to increase my digital storage capacity but that is not a high priority for me right now. All in all, I’m very pleased with this and it is working great. Read more\n"

Much to my disappointment, the package got 'lost in the mail' so I ended up ordering this camera system by sheer luck. I had been watching several review videos trying to decide between Arlo and Ring since both were on sale via Black Friday when I saw these. The one thing that attracted me to these were the price and NO MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE!!!!!!Fast forward got it delivered and was very happy with what I got. I received 3 cameras and a base station. Base station is very small and sleek and has great range to to my cameras. Cameras are decently heavy and don't feel cheap. They don't come that charged, so I had to charge them one by one off the base station(which didn't take long).Setup was a breeze. Plugged the base station in, hooked it up to the ol modem via ethernet cable and downloaded the app and followed the setup instructions. It's a pretty straightforward process. Set up an account and the app walks you through the rest of the process step by step. What I liked about the app is you can take your phone over to a spot you want to put a camera and it'll tell you the signal strength; which I found extremely useful and helped to determine where to put my cameras. Installing the cameras took no time at all either.Once the cameras were set up, we did some test runs and everything worked great(at first). The picture quality is great. The night vision is amazing. The microphone is so good I can hear our conversations inside the house. The app was user friendly as well. On a side note, there is a small delay in response time as far as notifications go, but it's not enough to matter. From what I've read, all the brands do. You have to be practical with your expectations too. The camera has to record, send that clip to the base station, then the base station has to download it and get it out to you via the internet. If you want faster response times, I recommend getting a fast internet connection.Finally, this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. After the front door camera was installed, it was super finicky. When we did test runs with it, it worked great. The next day, however, we had received 2 packages and didn't receive notifications. Then we started conducting more test runs and still couldn't get it to work 100%. Frustrated, we finally took the camera down and repositioned it. Since then, we have had zero problems. All 3 cameras work flawlessly. We think the problem was the angle we had it positioned and we had it up a little too high. We moved it down some and centered it on the door and it did the job.If you're trying to decide and are a researcher like I am, go with these cameras. I feel very satisfied with my purchase. They have worked great and are such great deal compared to the other systems out there; especially since there is no monthly subscription fee. If you do decide to buy these, I just recommend installing them between 6 to 8 ft from the ground and you shouldn't have any problems. Read more\n"

We have outside cats and I am able to control settings so it doesn't alert every time they walk by. One of the best things is you don't have to sign up for a subscription service! I simply have the camera alert me in real time so I can watch who is at the house. I can then delete the short video at my convenience. The set up.was really easy. We are an older couple and dread purchasing electronics because set up for us is usually a nightmare and we end up arguing and calling a young person for help. Not this time we walked right through the set up with no issues! Read more\n"

I don'tlove that you need to pay to have the benefits though. You have the option for a free trail for 30 days. It has the mount and nails to mount it and that was also very easy andstraightforward! It took about 5 minutes to set everything up. It is super sensitive so we toned down the sensitivity because we were getting notifications constantly so that was so nice! It has night vision, sensitivity levels, spot light, and audio settings. It's so nice that we can customize it to what we need. The picture is so clear and the video is even better! It takes little videos that are easy to watch and easy to delete if you don't want them. I do wish that it could swivel but it only goes side to side not up and down. It's nice too that you can recharge it. I've had it going for 3 days and it's at 75% battery! It uses the common iPhone charger so l don't need a special one. It took about 1.5 hours to charge it when I got it out of the box. It's such a great little security camera and I love how easy the app is to use!! Read more\n"

Setup was super simple, requiring little more than mounting and a couple minutes to connect it to my Alro hub. Video quality is great and it all comes at a nice value. Battery life is more than sufficient for the size and ability to connect to a 5GHz wifi network. Recording events is simple and HomeKit integration is a must.Overall, I'm very happy with the functionality, brightness, and features of this camera. It's a great addition to my home security setup.
