                    "comment": "This plan-tilt device is the missing link in the Ring catalogue... spotlight, searchlight, and small static indoor cams, a mailbox sensor,chimes, doorbell cams already onboard, but this cam, which pans and tilts on command from the Ring app, adds a bow to the package. Wall mounting is tricky, tho, and for mwe required drilling a hole in the plastic mount and securing it with a larger, longer screw than the ones provided in the box. Ring app already on our devices, adding this one was simple, 1st time maniputated from the Ring dashboard, it worked like a charm. This is our screened porch cat cam, mounted abojt 7 feet up the interior wall, makes us feel they're secure, they don't seem to mind being on camera, night vision feature is terrific. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "I recently added the Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam to my home security setup, and I couldn't be happier with the decision. Living in a bustling area of New York City, I wanted a reliable way to monitor my apartment, especially when I'm away.​Setup & Design:The installation was straightforward—just plug it in, connect to Wi-Fi via the Ring app, and it was ready to go. The sleek design blends seamlessly with my home decor, and I appreciate the variety of color options available.​Functionality:The 360-degree pan and 169-degree tilt features are fantastic. I can remotely adjust the camera's view to cover every corner of the room, ensuring comprehensive coverage. The 1080p HD video quality is crisp, and the color night vision provides clear images even in low light. The two-way audio is a bonus—I can communicate with my pets or visitors when I'm not home.​TechRadar+1TechRadar+1The Verge+1TechRadar+1Integration:Being part of the Ring ecosystem, it integrates seamlessly with my other Ring devices. The app provides real-time notifications, and I can access live views or recorded footage with ease. While some features require a Ring Protect subscription, I find the added benefits, like video history and person detection, well worth the cost.​Peace of Mind:Since installing the camera, I feel more secure knowing I can monitor my home anytime, anywhere. Whether I'm at work or traveling, I have peace of mind that my space is protected.​Overall, the Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam has exceeded my expectations. It's a versatile, high-quality addition to my home security system, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their indoor surveillance.​ Read more\n"

                    "comment": "I am very impressed so far with these cameras. First off, very fast delivery, as I ordered them on Friday and got them Saturday. Set them up today, Sunday, and the setup process was very easy and the ring app is too! I do have them both sitting on window seals, as they are the perfect size, not too tall, not too short, same for skinny or fat. One is in my window seal in the front of the house and the other in the window seal in the back of the house. Picture quality is great, but for the night vision to work properly, you do have to go into the settings in the ring app and shut one of the options listed in there to off, otherwise it will cause a major glare. Only gave it 4 stars again, as I didn't have any package deliveries and I basically bought it for that purpose, as I don't live in a 'crime' area, but you never know when a pkg could be stolen, I live on a very busy street, so I have to wait and see how they pick up the delivery drivers coming to my doors. But, I do feel more secure and safe with these cameras as well, you can check them anytime you want in the ring app on your mobile phone/tablet and review history or current status, even though you will get an alert if there are subjects picked up on camera, but since this is new to me I like to go and check them even without any alerts. Now the picture quality like I said is great, but not exceptional, as the cameras are in front of windows, but I really really like them! I am glad I purchased them and so far worth the price! The plug in cord is long which is nice, but I did order additional plug in cords that are 16ft if and when I may need them, but I may return those, as I don't plan on moving the cameras from where they're sitting now anytime soon. Would love to give them 5 stars, but again have to wait for more deliveries to my doors. Lastly, ring gives you a 180 day trial period to see if you like how the recordings and such are working out for you before you subscribe, which is great, even though I will be purchasing the subscription, you never know when you will need proof of something on camera! Better to be safe than sorry! Hope this helps. Read more\n"

I wanted an indoor camera with excelent picture quality and panning capability to see the whole room so I could check on my dog when I'm away from the house. Since I already have some cameras, there was no additional cost to set it up and stream and record via my phone. It give me a complete 360 degree view and I can even tilt up and down remotely.Easy to install and I was up and running in no time.I bought the white to fit in with my decor but its available in black, gray, a rose color, and starlight (kindof an off white). I also have Alexa and this camera is fully compatible with Alexa devices.Overall, a very nice product that I recommend. Read more\n"
