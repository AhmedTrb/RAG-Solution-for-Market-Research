You can do so much within the app. Like zoom in on the picture or vehicle. You can set the range of your camera's. They have night vision and so much more.

I like that you can set up multiple cameras and create a group which makes viewing all of them easy. They are not very stable if you just place them on a flat surface (table/ counter) and often fall forward. I have a love/hate relationship with the power of them- I like that it’s a constant power source and you don’t have to worry about batteries but the downside is that you have to reconnect each camera and reset them up in the app every time you unplug them. The sound quality- both hearing what’s on the camera and the voice functions are great. I do find that they are ultra sensitive with motion, but there are multiple adjustments that can be made in the app. The night vision is by far one of the best I’ve seen for the price range. There is a slight lag when going on the app to connect to the live feed of the cameras, but overall functionality is great. They are a great value for the price. Read more\n"

Just plugged it in and only required a couple clicks. Only had to confirm WiFi network, approve adding to cam+ account and assign/skip adding cam to a group. Most of the 55 seconds setup was the cam connecting to WIFI. (Note: Adding cam to existing network was much easier/quicker than before. Initial setup will take longer for first time Wyze cam users)Image clarity on v3 wasn’t bad, but incredibly clear now, including low light. Ive noticed in some v3 models, the cmos sensor is too sensitive and sometimes creates white patches in bright (but normal) lighting. Problem no more. Clear images even under variable lighting scenarios. In addition to improved cam functionality, the UI has been overhauled and has a ton of enhancements.Some new functions I didn’t even know I needed. Too many to mention but largely related to completing actions with merely a swipe. The new screen layout is more intuitive with action icons available at top level without have to click into submenus. Split screen has finally been added allowing you to watch a cam feed while navigating to other pages. Sound quality and clarity is also improved. The cam appears to made from a different material with a matte finish. The look is improved and I’m hoping durability remains good. There are many more enhancements, only named a few. The people who ensured focus group feedback was implemented to such a high degree should get bonuses!For $30 it’s really worth it. My current mostly v3 camera array is working well, but the v4 is so superior I plan to swap out the most important cameras. Read more\n"

Right out of the box, it was a breeze to set up—just plugged it in, connected to WiFi through the app, and it was ready to go in minutes.We placed it on a shelf in the garage, and it works perfectly for what we needed. The image quality is super crisp, and it even works really well in complete darkness, which was a nice surprise. The night vision is impressive for such a small, budget-friendly camera.It’s worth noting there is a subscription if you want features like cloud recording, but you don’t have to get it—the live view and basic functions work without it. For the price, it’s honestly a fantastic value Read more\n"

I just purchased this newer v4 2.5K version and it arrived today. I just set it up in our living room. WOW WOW WOW! Incredible high-rez picture! We plan to use it to keep an eye on things when we go out of town in a few weeks. I like that you can turn off the camera right from inside the app (don't want it spying on us when we're home). It also has a little spotlight if you need it, remotely accessible from the app. Since I already have a Wyze camera in the garage, I already have the app and a Wyze account. The setup was so easy. Plugged it in and it started talking to me. Went to the app and clicked the '+' to add a new device. So easy. I also got an SD card so that it can record right to it without having to purchase cloud storage from Wyze. I think I may get another one to monitor our backyard. In fact, for the price I may replace my garage one v3 with a new v4. The 2.5K video quality is stunning. It also supports the wi-fi 6. It also supports Alexa so I can see the video feed on the Alexa Show. Can't say enough about this device Highly recommend it. Read more\n"

The night time real color feature is awesome. The price, ease of install, good app for phone, and able to install on PC using Bluestacks makes these cameras a must buy. Being wired for power, the camera never stops or shuts down since there isn't a battery that limits viewing. Its been a week and I have those two running on a monitor 24/7. Totally worth it, reolink is a bust and a buggy device, but Wyze has the goods and proves it every time I look at the screen with that clear color picture. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "Got two of these after I wasn't finding anything I liked for a new baby monitor. The fact these are always running but connect to our phone is a lot nicer than carrying around the parent unit of our old monitor, which we also needed to plug in often as it's battery life was terrible. Plus, once we don't need monitors anymore, I can use them as actual security cameras.These have a very nice, modern look, and the build quality is actually great considering the price, I expected these to feel a lot cheaper. They have a full range of motion, which is a massive boost over our last baby monitor, which didn't move at all. They also come with cords and a power adapter, which is great since many companies stiff you in this area, expecting you to pay for adapters or use others that you already own (looking at you cell phones).I'll preface this section by clarifying that we're using these in conjunction with an audio only baby monitor. This is because my wife wanted something that would quickly play the sound in each room if it heard crying. To be clear, the camera will play audio just fine, but having the app open constantly isn't ideal, and when it's not open it sends notifications of a sound or motion event. The speed of these notifications is very fast, but the sound isn't enough to wake us at night, wheras the sound of crying wakes us up fast.When the camera detects motion, it's default setting is to track the source until it stops moving or leaves it's view. This is incredibly cool and a great feature in a security camera, but for a baby monitor, it's less great, at least for older kids, as they'll be drawn towards it's movement and either be scared of it, or try and play with it (if it's reachable). I turned off the motion alerts so the camera remains fixed wherever I point it, and I can move it in the app if necessary.For sound alerts, as I said before, they're quick to notify you if the app isn't open, and the sound just plays if you're viewing the camera. There is actually a setting to have it trigger alerts on crying sounds vs other sounds, however this feature is locked behind the subscription service, so I was not able to test this. Regular sound alerst work pretty well, and didn't trigger for our ambient noise machine, but it did for loud cars going by (we get a few annoying drivers late at night) and once for a train horn in the distance (bit surprised at that one, but speaks to it's mic I guess).The app is nice to use and fairly straightforward, and you can easily view multiple cameras at once, and select one of them if you want to move the camera or hear the audio. You can also create a widget on iPhone (and I'm sure on Android as well) that links directly to the camera feed, so you don't need to swipe around looking for the page or folder you put the app in, open it and then open the feed, rather just swipe to the widgets and tap the button to jump right to the feed. If you have two cameras, you can have both there and swipe before tapping to swap between.Overall very nice cameras, they make great baby monitors on their own or coupled with an audio monitor, and for a far more affordable price (even with a two kid audo monitor, and two of these cameras, it came out almost $50 less than a two camera baby monitor on the cheaper end).

                    "comment": "Review is on 2023-03-12.Having owned the Wyze Cam V3 as my introduction to the brand - moving to the Pan V3 was almost a natural path. It's a great camera for a great price. The bulk of the company's money seems to be made on the subscription side, so the hardware price is sold with minimal markup it seems.The camera itself - hardware and quality - are not much different from the regular V3. Good picture quality and such. There are 3 primary differences between the Pan and the regular V3.1 - Panning capability. The camera can turn - not 360 - but almost.2 - Not magnetic. Must be mounted on the provided base - or similar item that the screw can fit.3 - Micro USB cable is right angle and not straight.PANNINGThe camera can turn almost in 360 degrees on the base. It has what's called 'waypoints' where 4 areas can be set and the camera will automatically move to each area once selected within the app.The camera supports time-lapse and motion following.NOT MAGNETICIf you wanted something similar to the regular V3 that you could stick somewhere - this won't do. Based on viewing the Pan V2 - they are similar in terms of the base. This does make some sense since the base can swivel, but it's something worth noting.USB CABLEThe regular V3 has lots of cables available that are weatherproof. Finding one for the Pan V3 - and I guess the V2 as well - is very tedious. The right-angle cable needs to sit inside the base of the camera and I've not found any extensions that have this feature. If you're going to purchase a third-party cable, you need to ensure that the micro USB end is about 19mm/0.75in so that it will fit snugly inside the base of the camera. This means you MUST use the original cable. I've not seen a similar right-angle cable on Amazon or even on the Wyze website - so there's no replacement. Another option - which I've done - is to buy an extension cable that is compatible with the device. I had a regular USB2.0 extension cable and it didn't work - guess it doesn't carry the voltage as well. Waiting on the linked device to arrive and test.https://a.co/d/3dER0lLI assume I'll either have to heat-shrink or tape the connection between the original cable and the extension. If someone else has seen the cable or something that will work - please link it within your review or as a reply to this one. The items below were found on the Wyze forums and linked here to make things easier.CABLEhttps://a.co/d/4ravLGoTAPEhttps://a.co/d/ceonpX3Additionally - if you're technically inclined - you could cut the cable and solder it to a different extension. Persons have said in the Wyze forums that it's only power - no data - so just 2 wires are required. Do that at your own risk.UPDATE - 2024-01-02So now. Having had the device for some time, I've used and abused it a bit and have more details to add for the review. Both the V3 and the PAN has had some weird issues for me. I'll get into those individually.V3 - I recently decided to go on vacation and didn't want my cat to be left without food. While my current solar setup isn't 100% - it provides enough power until about 2AM and the area is secure enough that a dead gap isn't a problem. I really just need the cameras to monitor my cat. So a typical 'pspspspspsps' call to get the cat to come around is used along with the name - but strangely, the camera seems to cut out with errors once this is done. Almost like it dies - has some firmware issue - or something. I'm going to test and see if it's the sound or pitch, but I've really not tested voice on any of the cameras for more than a few seconds previously. To get the attention of my cat I need like 1-2 minutes per camera. When the camera goes offline, it needs to be manually power cycled in order to be available again. Since my solar setup dies and comes back, that works out for the V3 somewhat, but it's concerning that the cameras have a flaw where extended voice or a sound/pitch will cause them to suddenly go offline. You may need to test this with your own cameras to verify.PAN - the V3 PAN has an even stranger issue. While it seems to share the same issue as above, it also seems to factory reset the device if there's the audio function usage or even periodic power cuts - which happens based on the solar setup I've got going as explained above. Again, this is concerning. I have to climb up on a ladder to physically reset the device and rescan the QR code to have the camera available again. This is very inconvenient.With those problems in mind, I think WYZE should have an option to 're-add' a camera that's giving issues. That way any existing configurations including waypoints can be kept and you don't have to do everything over from scratch - including sharing the camera with family members if you do that.Again - hopefully this review helps and persons can be aware of potential flaws. Overall - still a great camera and the functions of the PAN are good. Read more\n"
