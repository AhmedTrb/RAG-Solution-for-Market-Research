I’m still surprised Google never made the floodlight capable of mounting under an eve without any adapter but since they seem determined not to address that mistake, this is a fine option. No complaints.Also, it survived a derecho, so there’s that. Read more\n"

I bought a couple and had them installed in minutes.Read the directions, make sure you look through all the packaging for screws, tools, mounting aids and it will go well.Another reviewer said he had to go buy machine screws. I didn't, here is a picture of all the leftover screws I didn't need.The locking screw worked just a as it should.My advice, ensure the wire nuts are pushed up into the eave, then the floodlight will lock into place on the first try.These look and feel like Google could have included them in the package with the light.

                    "comment": "So Google kind of screwed the pooch on this design, since a wall-mount can't really be angled easily. If you eave-mount on a low eave without it, it's impossible to angle the camera up enough to get a good face picture and the motion detector won't work well.Eave mounts are so unusual for these that neither I nor my electrician thought to check if that would work, so the work box was already installed before we realized. That's how I found this.This part installs *very* quickly, looks like it belongs, and solves the problem completely. BEST OF ALL, now you have some play in how you attach the plate, and can angle it however you want, instead of straight off a wall. Essentially fixes the flaws in this design. Read more\n"

While I managed to get the job done, it wasn’t without some frustrations due to the design of this mount. On the positive side, the build quality is excellent—it seamlessly matches the materials of the Google Nest Cam Floodlight, making it look like a cohesive, factory-made piece. However, the design could use some refinement, as it doesn’t provide much space for mounting or wire storage, which made installation more cumbersome than it needed to be. Read more\n"
