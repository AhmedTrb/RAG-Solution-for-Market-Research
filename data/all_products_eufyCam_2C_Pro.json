                    "comment": "The media could not be loaded. I bought these a couple months ago to replace a set of Arlo cameras after getting annoyed that they started charging a monthly fee for their services. Eufy had what I wanted with a good quality resolution cameras, local storage, and a number of AI features.First, the good -- super easy setup- great quality camera resolution with enough settings (ie. Spotlight, night vision settings, activity zones, etc). The recording attached is from the middle of the night with only the camera spotlight providing the light, and it’s still good quality.- long battery life (after 2 months I still have 70%+ in all cameras, including some that record frequently- the local storage is great. Even with just the included storage, I have more than I need to record multiple months. When accessing old recordings, it’s super fast to pull them up and play them, which was an issue with some other camera sets I tried (like TP- Link Tapo cameras with onboard storage)- the app is easy to use and seems reliable - I have tested geolocation options which worked well, but also scheduled options and the camera accurately changes modes in both settings- No subscription fees!The areas for improvement:- the app doesn’t allow you to mix scheduling and geolocation modes, so if you wanted to put it on a schedule when you are Home, and arm all cameras when you are Away that’s not an option for you- the AI isnt great - while I like being able to name the people in footage, Eufy doesn’t often recognize them in the future. It’s not a big deal as the camera still recognizes its a Person, but just cannot tell me who without some time.Overall, I would still highly recommend these for someone looking for a subscription-free, high quality cameras set. Buy when they are on sale and save yourself $150-200 of the list price. Read more\n"

The AI Motion detection isn’t perfect, but has been getting better as the system learns. Notifications to my phone are near immediate, and the delay from live to my device is only around one second. The local storage is awesome, no need to pay extra for cloud storage to save video clips! Video quality is solid, live is a little bit low-res but saved clips are in excellent 4K. Battery life is decent, and so far even arctic temperatures didn’t have a major impact. Pair this with the video doorbell and this is a solid monitoring system. Read more\n"

What I like about the.Eufy system is that the camera quality is better and the night vision is better. Additionally, you don’t have to pay for storage. So many of the competitors trick you into thinking that until you get the product home. These were so easy to install and connect to my Wi-Fi. This week, when I was not home, I received an alert that someone was at my front door. The motion detection feature picked him up immediately and alerted me through the app. It was a delivery man, and I was able to communicate with him from another state to let him know where to leave a package. It was very easy to hear him an easy for him to hear me as well. There are just so many good features that you get with Eufy system versus the competitors that I would highly recommend this product! We have even purchased more for family members. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "Was a little worried about purchasing this after some of the negative reviews came out about the end-to-end encryption on the live video streams and The fact that unsinking the camera removes the footage. However that seems to be fixed in this latest version.They work well as front door cameras for me in an apartment building. The 4K quality is reasonably good. I shoot with a lot of cameras so I was actually semi-impressed for the price how good the camera turned out to be. Granted I wish the infrared light was stronger so it would work in darker indoor spaces. I have them about 4 to 5 ft on either side of the door facing down at a 45° angle. If the lights aren't triggered in the hallway the infrared lights don't necessarily pick up anyone until they touch the door. Even if they sold an accessory like an IR light that was tied to the cameras it would help.Overall I like how the footage stays on the internal 4 TB hard drive I installed in the base station. I'm not sure I can really comment about the signal quality because my apartment is open concept so they have worked very well. The camera's battery life seems to work well. We will see how they hold up didn't want to bother getting the solar panel versions because I use them indoors.The facial detection works frighteningly and surprisingly well. I wish it had more functionality built into the app hopefully they will update this in the future, because it's kind of not very powerful in terms of the stuff you can do with it. It will recognize almost any face that's at 45° angle to the camera. It seems to have a little trouble if someone is profile but it's pretty close.I like how you can name, and assign tags for individuals. But sadly that's really all you can do with it. It's is very basic. There aren't many tags and there isn't really any functions tied to them in terms of notifications or triggers.For example I actually bought the cameras to make sure a certain person was not coming over unannounced. I was having an issue with this person and possibly considering a restraining order.I had hoped that using the facial recognition software I could set up an alert and actions specifically based on that person.Sadly the app doesn't really work like that. The alerts and actions are all the same and has no integration with the actual facial recognition other than telling you the name and the pre-selected category.I could see this is a very helpful tool for people who are considering restraining orders. Because you would be able to have documented evidence that someone showed up and you could have a custom notification sent to you immediately. So I'm sad it's not more of a feature.I'm also kind of sad that I couldn't do the reverse for my neighbors. I don't need the cameras being triggered or alerting me every time my neighbors leave the apartment. Especially if their face is recognized by the device.I get why the system functions the way it does. It's the simplest implementation of the facial recognition software which keeps the data processing down, and works ok as a novelty for basic family setups. But it would work way better with custom notifications and actions assignable to each person, And I think it could be easily added to the apps functionality.Overall I think it's one of the better security systems on the market since I don't have to sign up for some cloud service and share my data all over the web. I also imagine it's why they can implement high resolution 4K cameras easily because those cameras don't have to send all of the footage to a server far from your house.If I had to score it, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars. If they integrated the facial recognition into the app better it would be beyond five stars and miles above any other security system on the market. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "GOOD STUFF!!!So far I have had an awesome experience with this new system. Eufy customer service is the best I have ever experienced. They answer quickly and provide real support and stand behind their product. I can't stress enough how the support and responsiveness has exceeded my expectations.Some things to note.. if you have a larger home 4000+ sf and have stucco/brick exterior you will likely need a second homebase unit. Do not expect one homebase3 to cover 6 exterior cameras around the perimeter of your home. I had multiple communication issues and camera offline issues until I split cameras between 2 homebase3 issues one toward the back and one toward the front of the home. After adding second homebase3 no issues. Cameras pull up quickly on the phone app. Motion detection and recording is flawless. The app is excellent and allows you to fully customize when and what gets detected on which cameras etc. You can also easily filter out areas of the camera field of view to avoid nuisance detection...excellent implementation.The ability to store all recordings locally on honebase is a huge plus..love it!! Love the solar panels.Love the AI that can learn and recognize family members and distinguish from strangers.. so cool. This company is really working on cutting edge features that I really appreciate and will leverage.NOT AS GOODThe mounting brackets don't seem as robust as I would like.. they work but the eufy3 cams are pretty heavy and you really have to tighten things pretty hard to keep the cameras secure and prevent it from shifting under the weight of the camera. Not a huge deal but would like something with a little more strength and adjustability.I ordered a solar panel for one of the cameras that is mounted in an area where it can't get sun. I wanted to be able to run a power line from the camera to a solar panel outside the patio to pick up sun and charge the camera. I ordered the panel from amazon but it came without a water resistant gasket for my model of camera.. the gasket keeps moisture out of the area where the usb c power cable from the solar panel connects to the camera. I called Eufy and they sent me a new panel which I was told would include the gasket.. there was also no gasket in the replacement panel from Eufy.. so long story short I still have no good way to use the exterior solar panel and I am hoping that Eufy will soon make these gaskets available for the eufy3 camera.

First of all going with solar was a great idea, I have never changed the battery in over a year and a half and it is always showing full.The video and audio quality is excellent, the night time mode is brilliant and the fact that there is no subscription is icing on top.The AI recognition is hit or miss but it does say it is in Beta.Notifications work great and the app for Android at least is great and easy to use. I like the fact that if needed I can grab video from the home base if needed onto a had drive or USB stick to turn into the police if someone was to come on our property.I wish I had bought a 4 pack back then because they are now more expensive. I will buy 2 more when my taxes come in. Great purchase. Also wish they had an outdoor/all weather doorbell. Read more\n"

It has been over a week and they have not been able to figure out why and how all of my cameras stopped showing the motion detection on the event tab of the phone (after the recent update). They don't accept the responsibility of their software update error rather assume on whether the camera was fully charged etc?As a security system: your job should be to make your customer feel secure; if you fail on that — you have failed yourself, not us. Customer can always fire you by buying another product of another reliable brand. And, thanks for your slowest customer service.-----------------------------------------------------The review below was reviewed previously (previous year)It is a 5 star product but 1 star less for not customer friendly customer service. 1 star less for inconsistent service and video quality when we zoom the video.The BAD:It's well designed and built with some defects.1. Camera shows connected but fails to detect motion consistently (1 to 2 times) each month. Not just 1 camera but all. There was no videos for motion detected events two days straight.2. Anti theft alarm does not work unless someone completely screws off the camera and starts to shake it off. I thought my 1 camera was like that and got the replacement but it turns out ALL cameras are dumb like that.3. Replacement was sent with prepaid USPS label, my work schedule did not work with USPS schedule and I asked if I could get UPS label but I was TOLD to drop it today to avoid the warranty. I had to praise his customer service skills.4. Image/ Video is only good when it is not zoomed in. Even in just 4X zoom it cannot even see the face properly (forget 8X zoom) but the way it is advertised is you can even see a grain.5. Very low level alarm sound. Only thief shaking the camera (not unscrewing the camera - because camera don't make noise until you shake it) will hear it. There was a cable guy installing the cable in my house, he accidently hit the camera and it turned upside the alarm was so low I did not hear inside the house and only realized after 30 mins of Installation was completed.Now The GOOD:1. Motion detection is quiet good if installed properly - it works.2. Night vision is good- but battery drains fast if used in color night vision mode3. Easy installation4. No monthly fees. But it has its cost. I ended up using professional monitoring service also because this is not fully reliable. Read more\n"

I’ll just cover 2 of the complete deal killer issues here, but there are additional problems with the Arlo system.First, a couple of the cameras will not stay connected and will not reconnect. I have zero connection issues with other devices on my wifi network and my connection speed to the Internet tests at just under 1gb per second. My doorbell camera will just randomly be offline and not work as does the wired floodlight camera. At this point the floodlight camera will not reconnect. I spent 2 hours of my time going through all of Arlo’s troubleshooting instructions before calling their customer support, which is apparently all based in India. I then spent nearly an additional 2 hours on the phone with their support doing basically the same thing.With this camera, it is located outside at 14’ high over my garage doors, so it’s not exactly convenient to spend a good hour’s worth hanging at the top of a ladder in below freezing weather. Regardless, I followed their instructions for nearly 2 hours which included sending them several screenshots verifying what errors their app was showing. Now I’m waiting until some other support people up their chain of command can call me back. Clearly there is either a problem with this camera or their software; neither of which I can control. I feel that I have wasted far more of my time than I should because their product has failed. It’s bad enough that this product lasted less than 2 weeks but now I am forced to literally waste hours and hours of my time speaking with people in India. I am done with this camera/floodlight.Now the worst problem with the Arlo product. One of the selling points is that, with their paid subscription, their camera software can detect the difference between a person, a vehicle, an animal and a package. Sadly, this is not true. I’ve now wasted hours on the phone with their customer support in India trying to resolve this problem with zero success.When “arming” their camera security system at night (or any other time for that matter) I do not need to have alerts sent to me because a squirrel ambled by at 3am. I also have outdoor pets that will also walk past the cameras all throughout the night and those too cause the Arlo system to send me a false alert that I have someone walking around home. It didn’t take but a night or two before we had to disable the alarm system all night to stop the constant false alerts.In order to try and prevent these constant false alarms, customer support had me turn the sensitivity down so far that the cameras won’t detect a person walking up to my door. The lady in India seemed to think this was a good solution! Then the other “solution” was to stop the system from contacting me when an alert was triggered. Again, this too renders the system useless.The addition problem with the Arlo system is that all these false alarms really kills the battery life of the cameras. Their solution to this problem is for me to buy a $60 solar panel for each camera. This adds enough to the already higher priced cameras that they are not competitive with the pricing.By the time you take into consideration the hardware problems, the connectivity issues, the software problems and difficult to understand customer support based in India, these factors totally erase any potential attributes to buying this wireless security system. Because of these problems, along with other problems I don’t have time to type out here, I see no value in the Arlo system at this time. I wish Arlo functioned as advertised but, sadly, it does not and I certainly cannot recommend this product and their required service. Read more\n"
