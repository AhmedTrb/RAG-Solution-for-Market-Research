This camera is extremely easy to set up, Google Home is a wonderful app that hasn't caused any issues for us, the design is nice and build quality feels solid. Connection to the camera is the best we've experienced (many cameras use 2.4ghz for streaming), which is awful. This has run at 99.9% consistentcy and even with that missing percent it was due to the phone not connecting, not the camera itself shutting off. We returned two Chinese cameras and got this camera, which was significantly more expensive but worth the investment. Night vision is excellent and there are plenty of other features within the app. Oh, and the AI it uses is incredible, you can record in your home and have it only recognize a pet or individual person instead of it notifying you of everything it sees. Talking through it also works perfectly. Little to no delay on streaming. 5 stars. Read more\n"

Since I have the top rier recording subscription it records 24/7. It was easy to set up and add to my Google home. NOTE: if you want this against your window and there is a lot of lightning outside play with the night vision option. When I turned nigth vision off the image improved dramatically. With it on it was way to bright and you couls not see much. Great buy with good 1080 resolution. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "I used to have a Dropcam Pro back when Nest bought Dropcam. Then, of course, Google ended up buying Nest later. I had moved to Eufy, and Eufy had some disastrous privacy issues leading me to switch back to what I know the best, Nest..err, Google.I got it hoping it would work well with Alexa (Amazon Echo Dot) to notify me of person alerts, etc, as Google had finally created an Alexa Skill. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The Alexa skill is limited, and can only send out alerts if unrecognized motion is detected. If the camera detects a person, even if not a familiar face, it will not notify Amazon/Alexa. This was not at all what I expected. The only way around this would be to turn off person detection and use motion detection, but that would be a considerable downgrade, and I paid a lot for this camera to get what it offers.I won't be the first to say this, but if you are used to the Nest app, do not expect the same experience using the Google Home app. Google Home app is much worse, even on Android. I'm not too fond of it, and they need to do more updates and overall UI changes for it to be usable. Read more\n"

So, we bought this and placed it inside the window pointed outside and it is adding the security we wanted. A couple of things to know. You will not get the outside sound using it this way so we muted the sound. It worked great during the day but when it got dark and the camera mode switched to night vision we could only see the camera reflection. We disable the night vision and it works great and we have more than enough light outside to see everything. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "I've been using Amazon Cloudcam since it's inception, unfortunately Amazon has discontinued that service. I was quite happy with it, cameras had good video quality (all things considered when they first came out), performance was good, desktop viewing, easy to load recorded clips.Being forced to get a new camera was daunting, I did as much research as possible and chose the Google Nest cam. Yearly subscription and features seemed good, cameras were reasonably priced compared to Ring and came with the Google Home ecosystem which was promising.Got my cameras, installed them and then all the issues started. First, there is NO WAY to watch your cameras from a desktop browser, this seems extremely nuts for me, how does Google, a tech powerhouse have no option for this? For my Amazon cameras, I would just log into cloudcam.amazon.com and instantly watch all my cameras at once. When I'm at work it was an easy way to monitor all my cameras at once. But for Google Nest, nope, you have to watch from your phone. Not ideal when I'm at work and you can't watch on a big screen. I can not express the amount of disappointment this brings. Apparently before Google bought Nest you could watch them on a desktop. So disappointing.I placed my new cameras on the same spots as my old Amazon Cloudcams, they are reasonably located from my WiFi router and boosters. My 4 year old Cloudcams performed flawlessly from these locations, video streaming loaded right away. Google Nest cameras constantly refresh with a black screen and give me constant 'Live video unavailable'. So far owning them for 4ish days I get that message 90% of the time. Performance has been extremely underwhelming for a Google product. How can brand new cameras perform so poorly compared to 4 year old 'obsolete' technology.You want to watch recorded video clips? Good luck, they take FOREVER to load. By the time they load your house has already been robbed. Clips taking up to a minute to load. These are recorded clips in the cloud, how can this be so slow? Again on my Amazon Cloudcam it takes about 3-5 seconds for a 5 minute clip to load. Google Nest takes up to a minute to load a 10 second clip.When the camera works (and its not often) the video quality is great, night vision feature is sharp, motion detection is also great. Unfortunately though the Google ecosystem is extremely subpar. Their Home app is also something to be desired. It seems so rushed and poorly designed, like a last minute 'we need an app' situation. The lack of customizing where you want icons placed are also so so bad.As for customer service, I chatted them today trying to get help, I've been on the chat so far for 36 minutes getting the same copy and paste answers from their CS person. Took 20 minutes for them to get figure out how to get me to approve for them to get into my system. Going on 40 minutes they ask me for a screenshot. Big yikes Google.I want to like the cameras but ultimately I will return them all (I spent north of $500 on all of these). Maybe try the more expensive Ring or cheaper Wyzecam.If you're looking for an easy setup camera system with little frustration, these are not it.Update: over 1.5 hours with Google support and they seemed clueless. Telling me to uninstall the app, turn off the cameras, asking me what phone I was using, it was all useless. Most of them I already did. Anyway, all 4 cameras have been returned to Amazon.While I was on the chat for over 1.5 hours I researched other cameras and decided to go with Wyzecam. $99 a year for unlimited cameras, web browsing included, color night vision. Cheaper pricepoint on the hardware too. Read more\n"

I reached out to Google about this and basically told me to buy the newer wireless cams as the warranty was expired - i would have expected a bit more from google as this is clearly a design/material fault.For the newer version, the battery life is just terrible, i am have to charge these cameras every 2-3 weeks depending on activity, its just a major hassle, especially when out of town.The transition from the nest app to the home app is also troublesome, i have older and newer versions of Nest and have to manage them on 2 different apps. Not Great - Conclusion, nest started out great, i was a big fan, but now i feel they dropped the ball on multiple fronts - I spent a lot of money on Nest for home and business, and decided its time to move on to another product with better features and less hassle, and no monthly fees.

This 3-pack of battery operated cameras failed to meet that expectation. Considering the 3-pack cost almost $450, I am severely disappointed in the shortcuts taken and the false claims about battery life.What you need to be aware of is that:1) battery life of these are not enough to get you through the night (if solar powered for example)2) providing power to the camera requires a unique Google proprietary cable.How many sets of power supplies and cables come in a 3-pack? ONE! I had purchased the 3-pack of solar panels and thought that would be the solution. Nope. One camera only ran briefly on this set up, and I still haven't been able to get the 3rd camera to connect (despite router and phone in the same room, so it has to be the battery or a broken camera.) So I have to play musical chairs with the one charger and power supply to get a camera up and running. One still hasn't but I will update when I find resolution to that problem.Frankly, I wish I would have stuck with the wired 1st gen cameras (indoor or outdoor depending on the need) and that's my recommendation to you.
