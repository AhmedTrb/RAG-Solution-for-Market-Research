Eufy had what I wanted with a good quality resolution cameras, local storage, and a number of AI features.First, the good -- super easy setup- great quality camera resolution with enough settings (ie. Spotlight, night vision settings, activity zones, etc). The recording attached is from the middle of the night with only the camera spotlight providing the light, and it’s still good quality.- long battery life (after 2 months I still have 70%+ in all cameras, including some that record frequently- the local storage is great. Even with just the included storage, I have more than I need to record multiple months. When accessing old recordings, it’s super fast to pull them up and play them, which was an issue with some other camera sets I tried (like TP- Link Tapo cameras with onboard storage)- the app is easy to use and seems reliable - I have tested geolocation options which worked well, but also scheduled options and the camera accurately changes modes in both settings- No subscription fees!The areas for improvement:- the app doesn’t allow you to mix scheduling and geolocation modes, so if you wanted to put it on a schedule when you are Home, and arm all cameras when you are Away that’s not an option for you- the AI isnt great - while I like being able to name the people in footage, Eufy doesn’t often recognize them in the future. It’s not a big deal as the camera still recognizes its a Person, but just cannot tell me who without some time.Overall, I would still highly recommend these for someone looking for a subscription-free, high quality cameras set.

However that seems to be fixed in this latest version.They work well as front door cameras for me in an apartment building. The 4K quality is reasonably good. I shoot with a lot of cameras so I was actually semi-impressed for the price how good the camera turned out to be. Granted I wish the infrared light was stronger so it would work in darker indoor spaces. I have them about 4 to 5 ft on either side of the door facing down at a 45° angle. If the lights aren't triggered in the hallway the infrared lights don't necessarily pick up anyone until they touch the door. Even if they sold an accessory like an IR light that was tied to the cameras it would help.Overall I like how the footage stays on the internal 4 TB hard drive I installed in the base station. I'm not sure I can really comment about the signal quality because my apartment is open concept so they have worked very well. The camera's battery life seems to work well. We will see how they hold up didn't want to bother getting the solar panel versions because I use them indoors.The facial detection works frighteningly and surprisingly well. I wish it had more functionality built into the app hopefully they will update this in the future, because it's kind of not very powerful in terms of the stuff you can do with it. It will recognize almost any face that's at 45° angle to the camera. It seems to have a little trouble if someone is profile but it's pretty close.I like how you can name, and assign tags for individuals. But sadly that's really all you can do with it. It's is very basic. There aren't many tags and there isn't really any functions tied to them in terms of notifications or triggers.For example I actually bought the cameras to make sure a certain person was not coming over unannounced. I was having an issue with this person and possibly considering a restraining order.I had hoped that using the facial recognition software I could set up an alert and actions specifically based on that person.Sadly the app doesn't really work like that. The alerts and actions are all the same and has no integration with the actual facial recognition other than telling you the name and the pre-selected category.I could see this is a very helpful tool for people who are considering restraining orders. Because you would be able to have documented evidence that someone showed up and you could have a custom notification sent to you immediately. So I'm sad it's not more of a feature.I'm also kind of sad that I couldn't do the reverse for my neighbors. I don't need the cameras being triggered or alerting me every time my neighbors leave the apartment. Especially if their face is recognized by the device.I get why the system functions the way it does. It's the simplest implementation of the facial recognition software which keeps the data processing down, and works ok as a novelty for basic family setups. But it would work way better with custom notifications and actions assignable to each person, And I think it could be easily added to the apps functionality.Overall I think it's one of the better security systems on the market since I don't have to sign up for some cloud service and share my data all over the web. I also imagine it's why they can implement high resolution 4K cameras easily because those cameras don't have to send all of the footage to a server far from your house.If I had to score it, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars. If they integrated the facial recognition into the app better it would be beyond five stars and miles above any other security system on the market.

Love the solar panels.Love the AI that can learn and recognize family members and distinguish from strangers.. so cool. This company is really working on cutting edge features that I really appreciate and will leverage.NOT AS GOODThe mounting brackets don't seem as robust as I would like.. they work but the eufy3 cams are pretty heavy and you really have to tighten things pretty hard to keep the cameras secure and prevent it from shifting under the weight of the camera. Not a huge deal but would like something with a little more strength and adjustability.I ordered a solar panel for one of the cameras that is mounted in an area where it can't get sun. I wanted to be able to run a power line from the camera to a solar panel outside the patio to pick up sun and charge the camera. I ordered the panel from amazon but it came without a water resistant gasket for my model of camera.. the gasket keeps moisture out of the area where the usb c power cable from the solar panel connects to the camera. I called Eufy and they sent me a new panel which I was told would include the gasket.. there was also no gasket in the replacement panel from Eufy.. so long story short I still have no good way to use the exterior solar panel and I am hoping that Eufy will soon make these gaskets available for the eufy3 camera.

I’ll just cover 2 of the complete deal killer issues here, but there are additional problems with the Arlo system.First, a couple of the cameras will not stay connected and will not reconnect. I have zero connection issues with other devices on my wifi network and my connection speed to the Internet tests at just under 1gb per second. My doorbell camera will just randomly be offline and not work as does the wired floodlight camera. At this point the floodlight camera will not reconnect. I spent 2 hours of my time going through all of Arlo’s troubleshooting instructions before calling their customer support, which is apparently all based in India. I then spent nearly an additional 2 hours on the phone with their support doing basically the same thing.With this camera, it is located outside at 14’ high over my garage doors, so it’s not exactly convenient to spend a good hour’s worth hanging at the top of a ladder in below freezing weather. Regardless, I followed their instructions for nearly 2 hours which included sending them several screenshots verifying what errors their app was showing. Now I’m waiting until some other support people up their chain of command can call me back. Clearly there is either a problem with this camera or their software; neither of which I can control. I feel that I have wasted far more of my time than I should because their product has failed. It’s bad enough that this product lasted less than 2 weeks but now I am forced to literally waste hours and hours of my time speaking with people in India. I am done with this camera/floodlight.Now the worst problem with the Arlo product. One of the selling points is that, with their paid subscription, their camera software can detect the difference between a person, a vehicle, an animal and a package. Sadly, this is not true. I’ve now wasted hours on the phone with their customer support in India trying to resolve this problem with zero success.When “arming” their camera security system at night (or any other time for that matter) I do not need to have alerts sent to me because a squirrel ambled by at 3am. I also have outdoor pets that will also walk past the cameras all throughout the night and those too cause the Arlo system to send me a false alert that I have someone walking around home. It didn’t take but a night or two before we had to disable the alarm system all night to stop the constant false alerts.In order to try and prevent these constant false alarms, customer support had me turn the sensitivity down so far that the cameras won’t detect a person walking up to my door. The lady in India seemed to think this was a good solution! Then the other “solution” was to stop the system from contacting me when an alert was triggered. Again, this too renders the system useless.The addition problem with the Arlo system is that all these false alarms really kills the battery life of the cameras. Their solution to this problem is for me to buy a $60 solar panel for each camera. This adds enough to the already higher priced cameras that they are not competitive with the pricing.By the time you take into consideration the hardware problems, the connectivity issues, the software problems and difficult to understand customer support based in India, these factors totally erase any potential attributes to buying this wireless security system. Because of these problems, along with other problems I don’t have time to type out here, I see no value in the Arlo system at this time. I wish Arlo functioned as advertised but, sadly, it does not and I certainly cannot recommend this product and their required service.

Much to my disappointment, the package got 'lost in the mail' so I ended up ordering this camera system by sheer luck. I had been watching several review videos trying to decide between Arlo and Ring since both were on sale via Black Friday when I saw these. The one thing that attracted me to these were the price and NO MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE!!!!!!Fast forward got it delivered and was very happy with what I got. I received 3 cameras and a base station. Base station is very small and sleek and has great range to to my cameras. Cameras are decently heavy and don't feel cheap. They don't come that charged, so I had to charge them one by one off the base station(which didn't take long).Setup was a breeze. Plugged the base station in, hooked it up to the ol modem via ethernet cable and downloaded the app and followed the setup instructions. It's a pretty straightforward process. Set up an account and the app walks you through the rest of the process step by step. What I liked about the app is you can take your phone over to a spot you want to put a camera and it'll tell you the signal strength; which I found extremely useful and helped to determine where to put my cameras. Installing the cameras took no time at all either.Once the cameras were set up, we did some test runs and everything worked great(at first). The picture quality is great. The night vision is amazing. The microphone is so good I can hear our conversations inside the house. The app was user friendly as well. On a side note, there is a small delay in response time as far as notifications go, but it's not enough to matter. From what I've read, all the brands do. You have to be practical with your expectations too. The camera has to record, send that clip to the base station, then the base station has to download it and get it out to you via the internet. If you want faster response times, I recommend getting a fast internet connection.Finally, this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. After the front door camera was installed, it was super finicky. When we did test runs with it, it worked great. The next day, however, we had received 2 packages and didn't receive notifications. Then we started conducting more test runs and still couldn't get it to work 100%. Frustrated, we finally took the camera down and repositioned it. Since then, we have had zero problems. All 3 cameras work flawlessly. We think the problem was the angle we had it positioned and we had it up a little too high. We moved it down some and centered it on the door and it did the job.If you're trying to decide and are a researcher like I am, go with these cameras. I feel very satisfied with my purchase. They have worked great and are such great deal compared to the other systems out there; especially since there is no monthly subscription fee. If you do decide to buy these, I just recommend installing them between 6 to 8 ft from the ground and you shouldn't have any problems.

It is super sensitive so we toned down the sensitivity because we were getting notifications constantly so that was so nice! It has night vision, sensitivity levels, spot light, and audio settings. It's so nice that we can customize it to what we need. The picture is so clear and the video is even better! It takes little videos that are easy to watch and easy to delete if you don't want them. I do wish that it could swivel but it only goes side to side not up and down. It's nice too that you can recharge it. I've had it going for 3 days and it's at 75% battery!

I was quite happy with it, cameras had good video quality (all things considered when they first came out), performance was good, desktop viewing, easy to load recorded clips.Being forced to get a new camera was daunting, I did as much research as possible and chose the Google Nest cam. Yearly subscription and features seemed good, cameras were reasonably priced compared to Ring and came with the Google Home ecosystem which was promising.Got my cameras, installed them and then all the issues started. First, there is NO WAY to watch your cameras from a desktop browser, this seems extremely nuts for me, how does Google, a tech powerhouse have no option for this? For my Amazon cameras, I would just log into cloudcam.amazon.com and instantly watch all my cameras at once. When I'm at work it was an easy way to monitor all my cameras at once. But for Google Nest, nope, you have to watch from your phone. Not ideal when I'm at work and you can't watch on a big screen. I can not express the amount of disappointment this brings. Apparently before Google bought Nest you could watch them on a desktop. So disappointing.I placed my new cameras on the same spots as my old Amazon Cloudcams, they are reasonably located from my WiFi router and boosters. My 4 year old Cloudcams performed flawlessly from these locations, video streaming loaded right away. Google Nest cameras constantly refresh with a black screen and give me constant 'Live video unavailable'. So far owning them for 4ish days I get that message 90% of the time. Performance has been extremely underwhelming for a Google product. How can brand new cameras perform so poorly compared to 4 year old 'obsolete' technology.You want to watch recorded video clips? Good luck, they take FOREVER to load. By the time they load your house has already been robbed. Clips taking up to a minute to load. These are recorded clips in the cloud, how can this be so slow? Again on my Amazon Cloudcam it takes about 3-5 seconds for a 5 minute clip to load. Google Nest takes up to a minute to load a 10 second clip.When the camera works (and its not often) the video quality is great, night vision feature is sharp, motion detection is also great. Unfortunately though the Google ecosystem is extremely subpar. Their Home app is also something to be desired. It seems so rushed and poorly designed, like a last minute 'we need an app' situation. The lack of customizing where you want icons placed are also so so bad.As for customer service, I chatted them today trying to get help, I've been on the chat so far for 36 minutes getting the same copy and paste answers from their CS person. Took 20 minutes for them to get figure out how to get me to approve for them to get into my system. Going on 40 minutes they ask me for a screenshot. Big yikes Google.I want to like the cameras but ultimately I will return them all (I spent north of $500 on all of these). Maybe try the more expensive Ring or cheaper Wyzecam.If you're looking for an easy setup camera system with little frustration, these are not it.Update: over 1.5 hours with Google support and they seemed clueless. Telling me to uninstall the app, turn off the cameras, asking me what phone I was using, it was all useless. Most of them I already did. Anyway, all 4 cameras have been returned to Amazon.While I was on the chat for over 1.5 hours I researched other cameras and decided to go with Wyzecam. $99 a year for unlimited cameras, web browsing included, color night vision.

One camera only ran briefly on this set up, and I still haven't been able to get the 3rd camera to connect (despite router and phone in the same room, so it has to be the battery or a broken camera.) So I have to play musical chairs with the one charger and power supply to get a camera up and running. One still hasn't but I will update when I find resolution to that problem.Frankly, I wish I would have stuck with the wired 1st gen cameras (indoor or outdoor depending on the need) and that's my recommendation to you.

First off, very fast delivery, as I ordered them on Friday and got them Saturday. Set them up today, Sunday, and the setup process was very easy and the ring app is too! I do have them both sitting on window seals, as they are the perfect size, not too tall, not too short, same for skinny or fat. One is in my window seal in the front of the house and the other in the window seal in the back of the house. Picture quality is great, but for the night vision to work properly, you do have to go into the settings in the ring app and shut one of the options listed in there to off, otherwise it will cause a major glare. Only gave it 4 stars again, as I didn't have any package deliveries and I basically bought it for that purpose, as I don't live in a 'crime' area, but you never know when a pkg could be stolen, I live on a very busy street, so I have to wait and see how they pick up the delivery drivers coming to my doors. But, I do feel more secure and safe with these cameras as well, you can check them anytime you want in the ring app on your mobile phone/tablet and review history or current status, even though you will get an alert if there are subjects picked up on camera, but since this is new to me I like to go and check them even without any alerts. Now the picture quality like I said is great, but not exceptional, as the cameras are in front of windows, but I really really like them! I am glad I purchased them and so far worth the price! The plug in cord is long which is nice, but I did order additional plug in cords that are 16ft if and when I may need them, but I may return those, as I don't plan on moving the cameras from where they're sitting now anytime soon. Would love to give them 5 stars, but again have to wait for more deliveries to my doors. Lastly, ring gives you a 180 day trial period to see if you like how the recordings and such are working out for you before you subscribe, which is great, even though I will be purchasing the subscription, you never know when you will need proof of something on camera! Better to be safe than sorry! Hope this helps. Read more","4.0","2025-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","4.0 out of 5 stars Really like! .  I am very impressed so far with these cameras.

They tried to steal power from me by running an extension cord from my garage. When I cut the cord, they threatened me, stole a surveillance camera, vandalized my car breaking a mirror, and knocked down another security camera. I caught them in the act and chased them away. Since then, I have come to believe it was actually young kids approximately the age of two ninth graders and an older one judging by their appearance on camera. Since then I have personally not had any more issues with them. But, I have every reason to believe they are still living in the house next door with no power because there are never any lights on. If they do not have power, in all likelihood they do not have heat either. I live in one of the coldest Metropolitan areas in the United States, and temps are starting to dip towards freezing.

As a result, last winter he ended up living in my garage. Some neighbors next door started bullying him and stealing from him.   One morning I went out to go to work and I saw an extension cord running from the garage to the neighbors house. I unplugged it. When i came home from work it was plugged back in. So, I unplugged it and cut off about half of the length of the cord. They came out and threatened me.   Later that night they came back and harassed my brother. One of them was out on the balcony. I yelled up to their balcony to stay the fuck off my property.   The next day, the Blink camera I had mounted to the garage was missing and the passenger side rearview mirror on my car was broken.   They harassed my brother again when i was at work. i came home from work early and caught two guys creeping up on the garage. I went after one of them and they ran away.   That was five days ago. They have not been back since, but I worry that they will break in when I am not here.   I already took a day off from work to board up a bunch of windows at home and replaced batteries in my cameras. i also want to set up one or more cameras inside the house. considering getting a dog. would like to set up surveillance on their balcony from my balcony but not sure of the best way without making it obvious. everything i want to do is stressful and expensive, and i am a little frozen at this point.   i am not sure what to do at this point.","reddit","173rlfs","1creeper","542.0","Living next door to a gang need help","https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/173rlfs/living_next_door_to_a_gang_need_help/","https://www.reddit.com/comments/173rlfs/","287.0","homesecurity","2023-10-09T13:18:12","","",""

I'll be following up with the county tax assessors office on Monday. Also wanted to mention our house is fully paid off and has been for several years.   Yesterday at around 3-4pm a lady pulled up outside my house and took pictures ALL around my house. Front, sides, back (walking around my backyard) and took pictures of my garage and shed in the backyard as well. She was taking pictures for about 25 minutes and then sat in her car for another 15 before driving off. She didn't do this to any of the neighbors. There is no HOA.   How concerned should I be? Any reason why someone would do that? I can't think of any company that would send someone to trespass like that without at least warning the homeowner.  Should i make a police report? TIA.   Edit: Since a lot of you are wondering why I didn't ask her, I have schizophrenia and at first, it was a question if she was even there at all. She turned up when I was out of work due to hallucinations that day. I took video of her and confirmed she was there, but the mind is a crazy thing, and I simply wasn't comfortable going out there at the time.

Might still be worth reporting and then asking if they received any other similar reports.","reddit","188bybu","6SpeedBlues","2.0","","","https://www.reddit.com/comments/188bybu/_/kbjusxt/","","homesecurity","2023-12-01T14:37:26","Someone trespassing to take pictures (Why?)","reddit_comment_kbjusxt","t3_188bybu"

Indoor Nest cam, 1080p  I have a google nest camera located inside my house pointed at my front yard. I originally bought to find out who/what was pooping on my yard. Found out who was.  I live on a public street on a cul de sac, so I also get my neighbors' front yards. Can't see into anyone's house/windows.  Turned out it was my neighbor with their off leash dog bringing their dog over daily to pee and poop on my yard.  I'm pretty confident my camera is perfectly fine, as its pointed at my yard, can't see inside other homes, can barely see them on their front yard if a neighbor is there, and they have no expectation of privacy in their front yard on a public street anyway. But I thought I was ask around.  The dog's owner sent me this text, after I got animal control involved, so I thought I was ask around:  ""You may want to make sure your camera doesn't look into anybody's house. The neighbors may not appreciate the surveillance. Looking at your grandmothers property is one thing but a high def wide angle camera pointed directly at their homes is an infringement on their and my privacy. Stick to your place. It may prevent lawsuits. Have a nice evening.""  Thoughts?  **EDIT: Thanks everyone. Looks like we're all on the same page. Grandmother and I are looking at speaking with a lawyer to draft a short letter to the neighbor. Thanks again!**  **EDIT2: I sent them multiple texts and they still persisted. Never returned my messages, but did once animal control had a talk with them.**  **EDIT3: I've removed the photo for privacy as this post has run it's course. I've also repositioned the camera down some as done of you recommended.

A police report has already been made. Today we cleaned up 20 nails in total.   I'm trying to get a recording of her doing this but I'm unsure what route to go. She only does it to the front 2 tires. I would have to run a wired camera through the yard but it would only get 1 side of the car.  I'm thinking of leaving a wireless camera on the dash of the car behind the one she's targeting. Maybe even on the underside of one of our vehicles?  With that in mind can you guys give any recommendations?  Edit: I was not expecting this to get as many comments as it did. I do have an update and I'll give some more background info.   I've been parking in that same spot for 3 years.  Other neighbors are unreliable, threatened us last year.  Our houses are next to each other but our driveways are at least 40ft away from each other.   There's a hedge between our houses and blocks the view of the front tires from our house.  2 full size rams fit in front of both houses with room to spare on both ends. My brother parks there probably a handful of times a year. Otherwise, I just park there.  Half of my car fits in front of my house. From the rear of the front doors to the grill is in front of hers.  We rarely interact with her. My SIL has asked her to pick up her dog crap a handful of times. It shits everywhere, including in our yard.  On Thanksgiving, our street gets pretty busy. A lot of big families. In front of our house usually gets taken so we just park around the corner. That day, I parked on another street so my brother could park closer. I left the other spot open for her tenant, which is on the other side of her driveway.  She screamed at my brother in the morning to not park in front of her house. He just said leave me alone and call the police if you have an issue.  Fast forward a couple of weeks, I'm replacing my side mirror glass because it was getting hard to see through. I noticed some screws/nails under my tires and 1 that looked suspiciously aimed at my tire. I brushed it off, thinking it was from our neighbor who just had renovations done. I cleaned it up and went about my business. When she came home, she pulled up next to me and stopped in the middle of the street to scream at me to move my car. I said I'm on public road and if you have an issue, go ahead and call the police. After about 5 minutes of repeating this/her yelling, she parks and watches me until I go inside. She realized I wasn't moving and started screaming at me to move my car, repeated what I said before and went in.   On to yesterday, my brother and I switched spots. His wife had been cautious after I told them about what happened and found 20 nails total behind both truck tires. She cleaned them up and put them in her mailbox. She called the non emergency line and made a report.   I'm guessing it wasn't busy because they actually came a few hours after putting in the report. They were going to talk to her for us. As she got home, the officers had asked us to confirm if that was her and as they started to move towards her. She jumped in her car and sped off. It wasn't anything as dramatic as a police chase, but they did pull her over and the 1st thing she said was I didn't do it. They told her we have video evidence of what she's been doing and if she continues, we'll be taking her to court.  No tickets were issued as far as I know. Hope that satisfies everyone's questions. Thank you all for the suggestions, we will be installing security cameras regardless. I also feel like we didn't really win because she could have caused serious damage. 😕","reddit","19146rb","Homgry_Deer","315.0","Please help me catch my neighbor","https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/19146rb/please_help_me_catch_my_neighbor/","https://www.reddit.com/comments/19146rb/","532.0","homesecurity","2024-01-07T22:11:40","","",""

My suggestion is to contact an Agricultural Radio Systems provider\*. Your situation is not all that unique people will steal anything of value. A decent pump radio provider can provide you with flow monitors and meters so not only will you know if the well is flowing you'll know how much they're taking. Additionally strobes, lights and bells at the well, a remote monitoring location or both can be installed, and all 3 wells could be put on the same system.   As far as cameras go, Amazon or Bass Pro/Cabellas sell cameras just like everyone is saying. I suggest you do what you can to limit the path someone would take to access the wells and then put your camera money there.
