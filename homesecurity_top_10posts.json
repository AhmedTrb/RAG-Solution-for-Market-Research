Figured everything was a okay as they weren't shy about calling if they hadn't received a payment a week before the due date.   Turns out they had gone through a merger and when they combined database, they didn't hook them up right.   So they were calling like 5 year old numbers but only for alarm notifications.   Billing figured their shit out, but the whole service you're paying for shit the bed.    \n\n\nI was like f you I'm out, then the whole ahhh your contract is up bullshit.  I asked them how they were fulfilling their contract if they'd been calling the wrong numbers for that 18 months.

When I cut the cord, they threatened me, stole a surveillance camera, vandalized my car breaking a mirror, and knocked down another security camera. I caught them in the act and chased them away. Since then, I have come to believe it was actually young kids approximately the age of two ninth graders and an older one judging by their appearance on camera. Since then I have personally not had any more issues with them. But, I have every reason to believe they are still living in the house next door with no power because there are never any lights on. If they do not have power, in all likelihood they do not have heat either. I live in one of the coldest Metropolitan areas in the United States, and temps are starting to dip towards freezing. Just a few weeks ago I felt a need to protect myself from these kids, and I still do not feel completely secure. But, i am also concerned, and I feel that their bad situation makes my home less secure. What to do?",

        "selftext": "My brother is schizophrenic and has been evicted from every place we have placed him. As a result, last winter he ended up living in my garage. Some neighbors next door started bullying him and stealing from him. \n\nOne morning I went out to go to work and I saw an extension cord running from the garage to the neighbors house. I unplugged it. When i came home from work it was plugged back in. So, I unplugged it and cut off about half of the length of the cord. They came out and threatened me. \n\nLater that night they came back and harassed my brother. One of them was out on the balcony. I yelled up to their balcony to stay the fuck off my property. \n\nThe next day, the Blink camera I had mounted to the garage was missing and the passenger side rearview mirror on my car was broken. \n\nThey harassed my brother again when i was at work. i came home from work early and caught two guys creeping up on the garage. I went after one of them and they ran away. \n\nThat was five days ago. They have not been back since, but I worry that they will break in when I am not here. \n\nI already took a day off from work to board up a bunch of windows at home and replaced batteries in my cameras. i also want to set up one or more cameras inside the house. considering getting a dog. would like to set up surveillance on their balcony from my balcony but not sure of the best way without making it obvious. everything i want to do is stressful and expensive, and i am a little frozen at this point. \n\ni am not sure what to do at this point.",

I'll be following up with the county tax assessors office on Monday.\nAlso wanted to mention our house is fully paid off and has been for several years.\n\n Yesterday at around 3-4pm a lady pulled up outside my house and took pictures ALL around my house. Front, sides, back (walking around my backyard) and took pictures of my garage and shed in the backyard as well. She was taking pictures for about 25 minutes and then sat in her car for another 15 before driving off. She didn't do this to any of the neighbors. There is no HOA. \n\nHow concerned should I be? Any reason why someone would do that? I can't think of any company that would send someone to trespass like that without at least warning the homeowner.\n\nShould i make a police report? TIA.\n\n\nEdit: Since a lot of you are wondering why I didn't ask her, I have schizophrenia and at first, it was a question if she was even there at all. She turned up when I was out of work due to hallucinations that day. I took video of her and confirmed she was there, but the mind is a crazy thing, and I simply wasn't comfortable going out there at the time. Now you know! ",

Police came really quick and it was a couple in their 20s. Police came to my door and said their phone is pinging to our apartment. Their story is they lost it in an Uber and just want it back. I explained to the police we have no idea what they're talking about we didn't take any Uber either. Plus who's dumb enough to try to enter a home at 2am. Me and my girlfriend are kind of worried they'll come back for a break in. Has anyone heard of a scam like this? Are they just pinging another phone in their bag or something?",

Grandmother and I are looking at speaking with a lawyer to draft a short letter to the neighbor. Thanks again!**\n\n**EDIT2: I sent them multiple texts and they still persisted. Never returned my messages, but did once animal control had a talk with them.**\n\n**EDIT3: I've removed the photo for privacy as this post has run it's course. I've also repositioned the camera down some as done of you recommended. Thanks everyone for reassuring me of my rights.**",

        "selftext": "Recently our next door neighbor has started placing nails behind 1 of our vehicle's tires. A police report has already been made. Today we cleaned up 20 nails in total. \n\nI'm trying to get a recording of her doing this but I'm unsure what route to go. She only does it to the front 2 tires. I would have to run a wired camera through the yard but it would only get 1 side of the car.\n\nI'm thinking of leaving a wireless camera on the dash of the car behind the one she's targeting. Maybe even on the underside of one of our vehicles?\n\nWith that in mind can you guys give any recommendations?\n\nEdit: I was not expecting this to get as many comments as it did. I do have an update and I'll give some more background info. \n\nI've been parking in that same spot for 3 years.\n\nOther neighbors are unreliable, threatened us last year.\n\nOur houses are next to each other but our driveways are at least 40ft away from each other. \n\nThere's a hedge between our houses and blocks the view of the front tires from our house.\n\n2 full size rams fit in front of both houses with room to spare on both ends. My brother parks there probably a handful of times a year. Otherwise, I just park there.\n\nHalf of my car fits in front of my house. From the rear of the front doors to the grill is in front of hers.\n\nWe rarely interact with her. My SIL has asked her to pick up her dog crap a handful of times. It shits everywhere, including in our yard.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, our street gets pretty busy. A lot of big families. In front of our house usually gets taken so we just park around the corner. That day, I parked on another street so my brother could park closer. I left the other spot open for her tenant, which is on the other side of her driveway.\n\nShe screamed at my brother in the morning to not park in front of her house. He just said leave me alone and call the police if you have an issue.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks, I'm replacing my side mirror glass because it was getting hard to see through. I noticed some screws/nails under my tires and 1 that looked suspiciously aimed at my tire. I brushed it off, thinking it was from our neighbor who just had renovations done. I cleaned it up and went about my business. When she came home, she pulled up next to me and stopped in the middle of the street to scream at me to move my car. I said I'm on public road and if you have an issue, go ahead and call the police. After about 5 minutes of repeating this/her yelling, she parks and watches me until I go inside. She realized I wasn't moving and started screaming at me to move my car, repeated what I said before and went in. \n\nOn to yesterday, my brother and I switched spots. His wife had been cautious after I told them about what happened and found 20 nails total behind both truck tires. She cleaned them up and put them in her mailbox. She called the non emergency line and made a report. \n\nI'm guessing it wasn't busy because they actually came a few hours after putting in the report. They were going to talk to her for us. As she got home, the officers had asked us to confirm if that was her and as they started to move towards her. She jumped in her car and sped off. It wasn't anything as dramatic as a police chase, but they did pull her over and the 1st thing she said was I didn't do it. They told her we have video evidence of what she's been doing and if she continues, we'll be taking her to court.\n\nNo tickets were issued as far as I know. Hope that satisfies everyone's questions. Thank you all for the suggestions, we will be installing security cameras regardless. I also feel like we didn't really win because she could have caused serious damage. üòï ",

Your situation is not all that unique people will steal anything of value. A decent pump radio provider can provide you with flow monitors and meters so not only will you know if the well is flowing you'll know how much they're taking. Additionally strobes, lights and bells at the well, a remote monitoring location or both can be installed, and all 3 wells could be put on the same system. \n\nAs far as cameras go, Amazon or Bass Pro/Cabellas sell cameras just like everyone is saying. I suggest you do what you can to limit the path someone would take to access the wells and then put your camera money there. Capturing a good license plate picture will go a very long way in providing evidence of who stealing from you.",
