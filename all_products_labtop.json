                    "comment": "I have had it for a couple of weeks now. It came well enough packaged. I did charge it fully before setting it up. It took a good hour or so to jump through all the hoops to get it working (not too unusual for a new computer, I think), and it took a couple of days to finally get all the kinks ironed out and for it to be totally reliable and working. Now it seems to work just fine, and it boots up almost instantly.My couple of complaints are:1: The charging block is pretty large, and the plug blades are positioned in such a way that on a plug strip, you either cover two slots, or you must use the end of the strip. I wish they had rotated the blades 90*. It would take up less space on a strip. Minor complaint, but still...2: The keyboard is lighted, which is nice. But the lights go out within a few seconds. I wish there was a way to make them stay on longer.3: It runs a bit hot, so I try to use it on some sort of flat surface so the vent on the bottom can be clear. I think there may be a fan in there somewhere. Again, a minor complaint, Heat happens, and you gotta get rid of it4: My biggest wish is that it had louder speakers. The speakers face towards the side and bottom, and are not very loud at all. More volume would be wonderful! That would be my one thing I'd really like them to work on. It is usable, but weak. On the other hand, the computer is large (and a bit heavier than I expected) so those little speakers are on each end, and provide wonderful stereo separation. I do enjoy having it on my lap and listening to some music videos on it. I just wish it had more volume.So, the complaints aside, I think it is a good buy, and the price was very good. For what it is, I could not come close anywhere else, and especially looking in some of the local brick and mortar stores. I ordered it one day, and had it in hand the next, so good and quick delivery.Would I buy it again? So far, yes indeed. It does exactly what I wanted it for. I don't do online gaming, so can't speak about that, but don't care anyway. I would recommend it to anyone else wanting a low price but functional computer. Two things I was looking for when I was shopping, was a solid state drive, and 1T of size, which this model has, so that was one of the selling points as well. Read more\n"

The price of this laptop, availability of colors, speed, 1TB drive, 16GB Ram, fingerprint set up instead of having to use a password, many positive reviews, and wanting to support a start-up company are the main reasons for my purchase.

Warranty for 1 year.System was completely removed from laptop while doing class work, sent it to Hp and warranty was voided due to the seller modifying the laptop and adding 1TB when it’s only suppose to come with 256gb. Reached out to Amazon and they said I should receive call from seller which I never did. After seeing everyone else’s reviews I’m sure I won’t get anywhere with them and not willing to pay a $200 bs restocking fee! Hubby is a computer wiz luckily (I should’ve let him look at it first but wanted to use my warranty).These computers are refurbished, all the parts are from HP EXCEPT for the 1TB Hard drive, which is made from Kingston. Did some research and a 1TB drive is only $60 (I would purchase a different brand than Kingston since it’s the cheapest, you get what you pay for).YouTube how to open and replace the hard drive (easy af) and do it yourself. But this company seems to make sure these laptops only last but a year which is terrible for people using their last to buy the price of crap, trying to get through school/work etc. Smh. BUYER BEWAREI brought the Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB hard drive from Amazon for $70 and paid an extra $12 for a 2 year warranty.. just installed it and re-installed Windows 11 and EVERYTHING was backed up once I signed back in to Microsoft which makes me extremely happy!! DO NOT send your laptop back to this company, they will only sell it again with a weak/used hard drive for $400 to someone else….It’s cheaper to fix it yourself. :) Read more\n"

I am part of a competitive gaming clan (Battlefield Brothers), and we have a couple of serious gaming hardware wizards. I have built a couple 100 systems in my IT career, but I listen to these wizards. They play with so many systems and test the limits of them. This is the system they ALL recommended and they were 100% spot on. It is extremely fast and I don't see the need to replace it for 4-5 years. I wanted a full gaming system that I didn't have to maintain. I did get the Lenovo full extended warranty for 4 years with the complete lost/stolen/broken replacement option. The warranty was surprisingly economical to get. The system comes with a 30% off coupon in the box.I did upgrade the two m.2s just because I wanted the faster and larger 2tb 980 pros. I haven't upgraded the memory yet, but I plan to do that soon. THAT is all that I will need for 4 years. No other upgrades are needed. Even these are more my vanity at the end of the day. After so many years of playing with hw, this is what I wanted! Nothing needed! It just works! I am very happy with it. I may not compete anymore, but I still game like a champ on it. When I got to competitions, it made it so easy! No huge case to ship and hope doesn't break. Business trip, lan party, or hospital, it works!It is EXACTLY what I wanted. I wish it wasn't so hot, and heavy, but it is still portable. The battery isn't the best, but what do you expect with a power-hungry monster like this. You can charge it fast with the provided Lenovo proprietary charger, or a little slower with an external USB-C charger. I use a 140-watt USB-C charger as my travel one. I have used an external battery to extend usage. Look, this is a BIG system, and portable. Laptop mode is not what I got it for, but it does work fine as a laptop. I used it in the hospital a couple of times already, and I wasn't disappointed.End of the day, if you want a gaming system, this is the one to get. Might be a 2023 model and it is still amazing a year later. Mine is now 1 year old as I am posting this review. I would still buy this exact model even today to save a some money on a 2023 model! No need to hesitate, just get it an be thrilled. Read more\n"

This is deff good for light gaming with nice performance speed and graphics, and casual gaming at medium levels. Tweak it a little in ur game options or try to add more to the hardware where u can, and u can get to some good levels. This is not for on-the-go or work/school unless ur willing to lug it around. It's a bit heavy. Tho im kinda smol. Still, the charger is a med size block like from the old days. If you're gaming you deff need the charger as the battery charge wont last more than 30 min- 60 TOPS. The fans are great at keeping it cool so far and i started gaming from day one of getting it, every day since. I spent 1,169 on this so if it is ever discounted deff get it. Finally a less expensive ~pRo~ laptop that isnt janky!Downloaded steam community, and played FO4, settlement survival, stardewvalley, the forest, and plan to try sims3 cuz the 600-700 laptops acted weird as f with that one lol.

I am tired of the heat they produce, the power they consume, and dealing with the hardware issues. I have waited and waited and now we are finally getting laptops that can actually handle the load of a power user who plays AAA games and works from their computer from home.This thing chews up every game I throw at it on Ultra settings. It's quite impressive. Once you take the time to properly undervolt it and adjust the fan curves it's even better. Yes, it can get a little loud under the heaviest gaming loads but that's fine. It's an easy trade-off to get rid of the massive towers.I bought a Thunderbolt 4 dock and it easily powers 2 external monitors running 2k@165hz. So we have a laptop that can obviously handle daily work with ease, but it can also play any game on earth on Ultra settings and you don't have to go back to a single monitor. You don't have to compromise one single thing.Personally, I did 2 upgrades once I got it. I threw in 64GB of ram and I put in 2x2TB 980 Pro SSD's.If you do buy this laptop just spend the $200 or so on the warranty services to extend the warranty/battery/Accidental Damage Replacement. You will easily be able to run this thing for years and years before needing to upgrade. One tip - buy a laptop stand that will allow you to raise the rear of the laptop. These gaming laptops do tend to get rather warm under gaming loads. Do NOT buy a cooling pad with fans. The Legion doesn't do well with them. The consensus with the Legion is it does best with the rear raised for proper heat displacement and airflow.Cons: It's heavy as hell. The battery life pretty much sucks but that is expected when it's running a 4080 but you can just use the iGPU for daily tasks to extend it. To make it clear: This laptop's intended use is not unplugging it and surfing on the couch. It's way too heavy and bulky for that. Just get a Surface laptop or Macbook for that. You will get MAYBE a few hours of use off the charger.So that's it. Yes, it's very expensive but no more expensive than building a tower with matching specs. If you are looking to transition away from towers this is the one to get. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "Windows S Mode and McAfee are glitchy performance killers and restrictive applications. Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not. McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps. Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store. In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing. There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop. Switching out of S Mode is permanent. All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed. Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue. I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC. A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added. No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC. After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home. At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install. This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad. The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that. However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully. I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment. Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop.One more annoying detail is that, by default, this operating environment is set to save everything to the MS cloud. The default storage of Document, Downloads, Pictures, etcetera, are all MS cloud folders which is where every file is stored unless you go through a few more clicks to store the files on your local laptop drive. By default, initially you cannot even boot up this laptop without entering your MS PIN to log onto your laptop, and thereby logging into your MS account at the same time. I found this a bit presumptuous that MS thought this was a good idea. Perhaps good for their own marketing efforts though, as some bot scans your files for things you do in order to tailor marketing ad pushes to you personally, but I digress. If you do not want Big Brother holding on to all your personal, professional, private, or other data, then you need to go in to system settings and turn off the MS log in PIN. Doing so allows you to boot up your laptop to your local drive account only. You can always log in and log out of your MS account if and when you choose at any time. Of course, you can even turn off your own laptop log in password so it just simply turns on. without a password. Your choice, as it should be. Read more\n"

Maybe it takes a $300 laptop so I don't have to deal with built in Alexa-enabled something, HP-specific ports, fingerprint scanner, and other stuff I don't want or need. They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal.You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine. Despite the lower-tier hardware it still starts up very quickly if you make sure you don't have too much bloatware. Sure it's a little slow at times but if you're using it for day to day tasks it should be fine. Battery life seems very good, the laptop is also fairly lightweight as well.

I am very upset they sold me a computer with this horrible glitch.Update*** still have the same problem, along with other problems as well. This laptop is a nightmare to do my work and school work on. I am going to list problems as I go along. One of many major problems I have is that you can barely find a black space to let the mouse rest while you work without it pulling down a drop down menu. I am so sick of these menus appearing any and everywhere.Next major problem is, if you go back to delete something you've written, which is what humas do many times, the backspace and cursor jump somewhere else which makes you have to wase time, your blood pressure rises because it makes no sense of why this happens. Every single time I have to delete something I've written it becomes a major problem.Another major problem, when you are sitting down and the laptop is resting on your lap, EVERY SINGLE TIME you get up from a seated position, moving your laptop, the mouse mechanism clicks itself so your browser closes out or your mouse clicks on something and you lose where your at or wind up sending something you didn't mean to which is A BIG NO NO.I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY DISKLIKE THIS LAPTOP. HORRIBLE!I feel very badly for kids whose parents make them use this laptop. I can only imagine the poor kids losing their work or their work getting messed up through NO fault of their own but they don't know how to convey that to the parents so it winds up being the kids fault according to the parents. I already know how many arguments this laptop has caused families.There is NO reason in this day in age for a laptop to be this horrible. As I am typing now, my cursor jumps everywhere and I had to restart what I'm writing 10 different times already in the last 5 minutes. I wish I could give this laptop negative stars!!!! I wouldn't take this laptop if it were for free! Read more\n"

If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers.5/30/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by 'Deal' for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery. I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365. Cannot return because I used it and is technically not broken. HP is obviously returning to the days of cheap low-grade Compaq. Clearest example of Greedflation.

Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "If you were like me, looking for a college laptop that would not break the bank, look no further. I am literally writing this review on this laptop in class.I just wanted a (Windows) laptop that I can code on and do a couple assignments while on campus. I never have to worry about the battery dying on me unless it was already really low. It is surprisingly fast but obviously not as fast as a $2000 laptop. Fast enough I would say.Right out of the box, I was instantly very surprised at how good quality everything felt and looked. It is actually pretty large in size but not cumbersome. But as I keep using it I do have some nitpicks about it:- The screen portion is pretty bendable to the point where I feel like you can easily break it. Now I don't know who would do that on purpose but you should watch out.- No backlight on keyboard makes it hard to see keys in low light.- Keyboard feels sort of hollow. Probably because it is cheap.- Fan is noticeably loud, say if the class is quiet. But I do prefer it to be cool and be a little bit loud than it be hot.- Fan ramps up randomly. Like I could have a simple assignment up with 2 tabs open and it could kick on for some reason even though the workload is not much. Then other times I have a bunch of tabs and another application open but it will stay silent.Other than that it is perfect if you need a cheap laptop to get some work done at school or code like me. Definitely recommend. Read more\n"

Now, I understand overcharging a battery can kill it. But six months?! And don't get me started on the noisy behind fan or whatever it is going on with the laptop. I mean, it works, but I shouldn't have to have it plugged in. I shouldn't have to hear it every single minute I use it. It truly sounds as if it's going to blow up. Idk. I'm just disappointed. I'm only rating it three stars because it technically DOES WORK fine. I use it to play the Sims, and it loads okay. It's just noisy and the battery isnt worth crap. Read more\n"

                    "comment": "HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) – Affordable and Portable, but with Some Trade-offs⭐ Rating: 4.0/5 ⭐Pros:✅ Affordable Price – This HP 14 laptop is budget-friendly, making it a great option for students, light users, or those in need of a secondary device.✅ Portable & Lightweight – The thin and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, ideal for on-the-go use.✅ Decent Display – The 14-inch HD micro-edge display offers clear visuals, though it's not full HD.✅ Windows 11 Home – Comes with the latest OS, which is optimized for modern applications.✅ 1-Year Microsoft 365 Subscription – A great addition for users who rely on Word, Excel, and other Office tools.Cons:❌ Limited Performance – The Intel Celeron N4020 processor is okay for basic tasks like web browsing, email, and document editing, but struggles with multitasking or demanding applications.❌ Only 4GB RAM – The memory is quite low for modern standards, leading to slower performance when multiple tabs or applications are open.❌ Minimal Storage (64GB eMMC) – The storage space is extremely limited, meaning you'll need external storage or cloud solutions for larger files.❌ Not Ideal for Heavy Use – Not recommended for gaming, video editing, or other intensive tasks.❌ No Backlit Keyboard – Typing in low-light conditions can be challenging.Final Verdict:The HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) is a solid choice for those needing an affordable, portable device for light tasks like browsing, streaming, and office work. However, its limited RAM and storage make it less suitable for power users or heavy multitaskers. If you need a simple laptop for everyday use and don't mind relying on cloud storage, this could be a good pick—but if you need better performance, consider upgrading to a model with more RAM and SSD storage.

S mode limits the software you can use to those available in the Microsoft store. It wouldn't let me use LastPass or Dropbox. It came with Dropbox for S mode, but I couldn't get it to run.I removed S mode - once it's gone it can't be restored - and Dropbox and LastPass ran fine as did Chrome. It took several hours for Dropbox to sync my files, but it did so effectively. Thus, I have access to everything on my hard drive at home. I plugged in a tiny Samsung 256 GB flash drive (it costs $22 on Amazon) into a USB port and now I have far more storage than I'll ever need on this computer. The drive is so small that I'll leave it there for the life of the computer.All the programs I'll need when away from home run on this device. I wouldn't try to use it for gaming, but as a work away-from-home laptop for relatively simple tasks, it does the job at a very affordable price. Read more\n"

It took three days of waiting for a response (one per day) to finally get my lifetime of office. Now, all the nonsense being said, once I figure out how to, where to... I love it.
